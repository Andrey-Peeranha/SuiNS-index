# Introducing sui.id

One of the benefits of being a .sui holder is all of the features that come with the Sui Name Service platform. One of those features that will be ready soon is sui.id.

## What is sui.id?

Sui.id is a feature on the Sui Name Service platform that allows users to bridge their web3 persona back to web2 devices. More specifically, SuiNS owns the DNS Web2 domain https://sui.id/. With this website we are able to accept requests through any browser, on any device, and automatically map the web2 address to your web3 .sui name. Here’s how it works:

Let’s say for example you purchased bob.sui from our website during the auction. When you own a .sui name you can point it to your wallet. Your .sui name also has a profile and allows you to set attributes such as a IPFS content.

Once you have either your wallet address or IPFS content set. You can tell sui.id to automatically route requests from https://bob.sui.id/ to your wallet or IPFS content. You will no longer need a special browser extension or a wallet installed on your device to understand where Bob.sui points to.

This is especially useful when you are on-the-go, mobile for example, and want to look up a address but don’t have it available. All you have to do is remember the .sui name.

## Sui.id Setup

The way to setup sui.id is to navigate to https://www.suins.io/ , login with your wallet, and click the Dashboard icon.

Select sui.id on the left-hand side navigation:

Once these settings are set, anyone (even your mom!) can go to the following website:

[https://bob.sui.id/](http://node.sui.id/)

and it will automatically route them to your wallet address (http://explorer.sui.io/your-wallet-address)

As well, if you select IPFS, sui.id will automatically map to the IPFS content hash of your choosing.

The team here is working hard to come up with new and interesting ways to utilize the sui.id feature to bridge the gap between the web2 and the web3 worlds. if you’d like to discuss more, come join us in the Sui Name Service discord channel at https://discord.gg/suinsdapp. We look forward to hearing from you!
